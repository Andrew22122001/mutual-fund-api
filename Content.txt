Spring Boot Project Architecture: What You Built

🧱 What Each Component Does

🔹 1. Order.java (Model)
📁 Package: model
📄 Represents the Mutual Fund Order table (Entity)
🧠 Think of it as: “Java class = Table”
✅ Annotations used:
@Entity → Marks it as a database table
@Id → Primary key
@GeneratedValue → Auto-increment ID
@Data, @AllArgsConstructor, @NoArgsConstructor (from Lombok) → Saves you from writing getters/setters
🔹 2. OrderRepository.java
📁 Package: repository
Interface that extends JpaRepository
✅ Annotations:
No annotations needed — Spring auto-generates all basic queries
🧠 Think of it as: “This is where DB operations happen”
🔹 3. OrderService.java
📁 Package: service
Handles core logic (create, get, delete orders)
✅ Annotation:
@Service → Tells Spring this is a service layer bean
It uses the repository to get/save data
🔹 4. OrderController.java
📁 Package: controller
Exposes REST APIs (/api/orders)
✅ Annotations:
@RestController → Marks it as an API controller
@RequestMapping("/api/orders") → Base URL for all endpoints
@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @DeleteMapping → For specific operations
🔹 5. application.properties
📁 Location: src/main/resources/
Used to configure:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
🧠 H2 is an in-memory DB (resets each restart, good for dev/testing)
🔹 6. OrderSimulatorApplication.java
✅ Annotation: @SpringBootApplication
Combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan
This is the main class that starts everything
🔁 Project Flow (Simple Words)

Client (Postman) → Controller → Service → Repository → H2 DB
🧪 Testing with Postman — Why and How?

🔧 Postman simulates real client requests
No need for a frontend; you test APIs directly
You used it to:
POST → Create order
GET → Retrieve all orders
DELETE → Delete order by ID
JSON format used in request body and response
🧠 Key Spring Boot Concepts to Remember

Concept	Description
@RestController	Handles REST requests, returns JSON
@Service	Business logic layer
@Repository	Data access layer
@Entity	Represents a database table
@Autowired	Injects one class into another
@RequestBody	Binds JSON to Java object
@PathVariable	Captures values from URL path
@GetMapping	Maps GET requests
@PostMapping	Maps POST requests
@DeleteMapping	Maps DELETE requests
✍️ How to Explain in Interviews (Example Answer)

"In my Mutual Fund Order API project, I created a Spring Boot RESTful service that allows users to perform CRUD operations on mutual fund orders. I followed a clean layered architecture with Model, Repository, Service, and Controller layers. I used Spring Data JPA with an in-memory H2 database for rapid testing. The service was tested using Postman, and all endpoints like GET, POST, and DELETE were implemented. I pushed the code to GitHub and wrote a detailed README to document the entire setup."
